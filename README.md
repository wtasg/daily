Your daily coding practice

## Problems

1. Roman Numerals to Decimal value


## Procedure and Philosophy

As a programmer, it is your job to solve problems on daily basis. But sometimes you do not get to solve a problem more than once, and sometimes there are no repetition and you do not get to improve your code quality or solution approach.

This repo allows you to pick up a problem, solve it however you want, and get it reviewed. When you solve a problem on regular basis and with different approaches, you will find that your skills are improving as you are learning the pros and cons of your various approaches.

There are few things you need to keep in mind:
1. You can improve your speed of solving a problem. This is a key skill.
2. You can test different approaches to solve a single problem. This gives you wider perspective and allows you to weigh different tools.
3. You can try with different tools to get a different feeling, like vim, emacs, or something else. This allows you to challenge your brain further as you walk out of your familiar, comfortable zone.
4. You put out your code for review by public, that alone is a massive green flag. It shows that you want to improve and are unafraid of a little criticism.

So clone it and take up the daily challenge. Master Thyself!
